# Python Challenges: PyBank and PyPoll
PyBank:

Given a company's financial dataset called budget_data.csv (composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses"), I created a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

- The total number of months included in the dataset

- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

- The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

- The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

PyPoll:

Given a set of poll data called election_data.csv (composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate"), I created a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values: 

- The total number of votes cast

- A complete list of candidates who received votes

- The percentage of votes each candidate won

- The total number of votes each candidate won

- The winner of the election based on popular vote

Python skills demonstrated in these two challenges:
- Importing and using modules
- Reading csv files
- Creating and populating dictionaries
- Statistical analysis of csv contents and dictionary contents
- For loops, if statements, try/except statements
- Writing to txt files
